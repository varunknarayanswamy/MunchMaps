# MunchMaps
This application is made for the CU Mobile Application Studio Class
Munch Maps is an application where users will be able to find local restaurants near them and add them to a library of their "known" restaurants, similar to how in spotify you can save songs
Users will also be able to save restaurants they want to try out and check out menu's, review, location and more.
